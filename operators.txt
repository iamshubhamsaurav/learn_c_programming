What is a operator?
An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable

6 + 7
a + b

Arithmetic Operators
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Remainder

Increment and Decrement Operators
++ To increase the value by 1
-- To decrease the value by 1


Assigment Operator
= It is used to assign the value to a variable
+= eg: a += b, it is same as a = a + b.
-= eg: a -= b, it is same as a = a - b.
*= eg: a *= b, it is same as a = a * b.
/= eg: a /= b, it is same as a = a / b.
%= eg: a %= b, it is same as a = a % b.

Relationals Operators

A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

5 < 7 = 1
6 < 4 = 0

Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.

1. ==	Equal to	                5 == 7 is evaluated to 0
2. >	Greater than	            5 > 3 is evaluated to 1
3. <	Less than	                5 < 7 is evaluated to 1
4. !=	Not equal to	            5 != 3 is evaluated to 1
5. >=	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1
6. <=	Less than or equal to	    5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0


5 >= 5 // 1 
5 >= 4 // 1
5 >= 7 // 0

5 <= 5 // 1
5 <= 7 // 1
5 <= 2 // 0


Logical Operators
1. &&	Logical AND. 
True only if all operands are true	If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.

(a == 5) && (b == 7)

2. ||	Logical OR. 
True only if either one operand is true	If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.

(a == 5) || (b == 7)

3. !	Logical NOT.
True only if the operand is 0	If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.
